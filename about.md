# About Me

Joshua Mckenna, who is he? Well, I am just a random guy who is 22 years old and loves making and creating things from my
imagination, starting from the time I was young and building things like a house module out of lego... then switching to
Minecraft. Eventually, I got into building and moderating Minecraft servers like Lifeboat Network. I also ran my own 
Minecraft server called Swiftraid, a faction server with its own custom plugins. In my free time, I also play Call of 
Duty on PS4 and a lot of other games. I enjoy mountain biking, four-wheeling, snorkeling, and a lot more.
